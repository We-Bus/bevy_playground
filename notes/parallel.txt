We want to make sure that as many systems run in parallel as possible.

Systems we need and what they need:

player_movement:
    keyboard
    mut transform With<Player>

camera_movement:
    mut transfrom with<Camera2d>, Without<Player>
    transform with<Player>

player_attack:
    transfrom with<Player>
    transform with<Enemy>
    mut commands

player_projectiles:
    mut transform with<Enemy>

enemy_spawner:
    mut commands

enemy_movement:
    mut transform with<Enemy>, Wihtout<Player>

enemy_collision:
    transform with<Player>
    transform with<Enemy>

tile_renderer:
    mut commands
    transform with<Camera2d>

--------- should run last
